Metaphorically speaking at 9 but then I walked away from that and my grocery list and then after I have left my job it was just me myself and I project management took my income from there and Amazon so I have left my job completely quit it was most of the school that I started work at 7 and so I was waking up around like 5:45 and then I was dropping her off at her mom's house and just to be traffic before 7 to get work at 7 o clock for me where I would open up my laptop every single morning I would look at my little my little girl on the bed sleeping peacefully and I'll be happy to structure excuse right in her sleep wake her up and get her in the car and the car but forgot 15-20 minutes dropping her off to her mom's house just so I can make it to work on time it was it was stress on her or my stress to get to work on time on to a 6 year old girl I was actually there and I took half a head taken everyone out for drinks when I made my first $4,000 prophet Kentucky from Amazon this is months ago and so we went to Echo & rig we then went to Revival and then from there we want the tiger moves back in ever since so then I have quit the job after 8 months of wanted to stay here and then so I ended up teaching and reaching out to people when on Facebook when I have left my job so then the way I did I get off on the timer right now I have a little under a thousand students you are in the e-commerce and I feel like most people be like dude you're letting you know did you ever feel like oh wait I might be too late to the trend I didn't know is Jeff Bezos write the founder of the guy that runs Amazon you guys rich is the richest guy in the world but Amazon's only in for Marketplace it's in here in the US right below that like having a prophet is the UK and then it's Canada and then it's Mexico what Jeff basil is State massive Global platforms right on pocket you look this up on YouTube or Google or Amazon Amazon Home Depot releasing an announcement a couple months back. They're putting their inventory on to Amazon platform bed King with Sears Walmart Macy's like they're all putting their entire inventory on to Amazon's platform so I know how to make it profitable or base of a Jeff basil is stating to the world and he has the finances multi trillionaire the finances to back up what he just stated is that he's going to put Amazon it every single Market Place globally so they're not taking it away from me on more and more and more. Third-party sellers aPA fbm in the wholesale and Retail my private label is that Jeff basil and his team only Owen at least 18% of the listing that you actually see that are on Amazon so that would mean the other like 80 something stuck in 3rd party sellers of average people like me and average people like you that are posting other people's products wholesale retail product label on it was called private labeling of the profit margin causes throwing out to members or say if it's $10 can you look at yourself $20 or 20 minutes a day write multiply that and then multiply that whatever that number is x 7 and multiply that times four and then you take however much it cost to get a rematch worth of socket in inventory and it's freaking facts or depending on the product and how hot the market is I mean I have my margin cost and all my profits on my products are over 50% so because I'm forced to have some success on it I was running an eBay business on the side but everyone that knows eBay or like any type of drop-shipping is he rad you got it you got to get it so much attention you're doing most of the Fulfillment you know the packaging and labeling the handling the customer Returns the answering emails like it a lot of groundwork Amazon is better than Shopify but the way that I am currently doing with my Amazon just launched a product that is coming in and should arrive sometime next month or like are they all like one place and tools and Home Improvement are hands-down the Third profitable products for the end of f****** time but it was always going to be sitting with these categories in so yeah it just asked why I left my job I looked at the market I knew how to do Amazon it was my laptop every single morning and I was like that's working for you it's freeze up your time sitting on your can do other things so that I left my job and it was just me myself and I. New outside of like my my circle and so I started to look at the market of what was the most common world's most common everyone had on Facebook groups died sending went to Facebook and I was typing and you know Amazon FBA and rather than going through pages I went to groups and then I sent requests on all these private groups and I was reading all of them like I read probably thousands of common and then so here's the answer to Plainfield in find a diamond product I showed him how to do it step-by-step step 3 4 5 and 6 so then that led the conversation that was my life these Facebook groups are thousands of people ride some of them are like 1.2 insane amount of people asking the same question but no one's really provided outside of their digital course of freely given starter or something like that yeah I had directed the conversation onto these, on this group pages to my inbox but then I would go to My Messenger on Facebook request message request message approve it and prove it right so then I figured out if there have to be an efficient way for me to I'm not wasting so much time answering just a generic a special to me and trying to convert My Little Ninjas I guess how did I find out. How to make money online kD with the name of showing the world that you can make money online no that's that Sam Joseph joseph Carter is literally his Instagram name is Amazon pays like yeah Katie is hands-down in my personal opinion the big Godfather of the guy he was doing affiliate marketing he was shell and he was showing people how to make money on real estate affiliation is he does not like he was showing pretty much how you can make money right now and how did you decide on Amazon music on shuffle I saw that Amazon was going in longevity was going to be the most profitable to start off with and I was kind of like he go at the same time and I wanted to be able to tell people like you'll do I build the business like this is my business model and I didn't necessarily want to be like in Philly right these are all even though I'm not the owner of Nike right I'm one of Nikes absolutely everything purchased directly from my inbox in my inbox if you can student and then people started on their own Facebook literally do without any advertising $0 till he's been on no Facebook app algorithm that you can trick it because there's not like a representative going and checking every single listing cuz if so which ones can you put on page one outside of hateful eight on page and every single one of my students that have launched so far the first part has arrived within 14 days Amazon but I can pretty much almost guarantee that you're going to make money off of students testimony ramey to Ronnie Ronnie from a different he quit his job with no with nothing without him out to me and now he's he's doing that are making more money than where I currently make right now on Amazon does it have some power behind it yet overall Spectrum if you give someone a better system that's what you had when you started they can go and learn from them so you just never know. Adidas Ro that's all zig zag and that's what everyone probably loves what we're doing right now podcast if they're interested in it of how to do it and now they cut off that statement of trial-and-error not necessary but we've found a more better more efficient way of hitting and that's why apple is I use Apple's you know all the time to iPhone is so freaking it's friendly user Reddit compared to a kid like crazy because it's it's user-friendly I just simplified Amazon to make it user-friendly and if it's exploded and So within 90 that is from what was once you myself and I grew to where that makes you be like without a shirt on Amazon so within how many months should you really start seeing a profit with after all the mistakes and all the trial and error teresa Giudice you know it in my face I guess it is really freaking to work and I'm just compared to my house I was thinking about business I wasn't going to think about any of that it was just like everything is somewhat decent be okay to always comfortable and then the moment I left my job that's when I was really like oh s*** what really defines an entrepreneur minded my opinion is someone that knows and that can find ways to make money continuously that is not a one hit wonder I mean I don't get it all the time now but cuz I think I'm pretty friendly is that I used to get when I was down the road but it is successful right now I can say like we'll go look at my previous history highlights on my stores on my Instagram account when it wasn't this big when it was just me and it was you. Before I make any type of Michael look back and see the progression where it's at so what what people used to say was a pyramid scheme is it's not going to work or now the same what are you doing how can I do it acquiescence because I had you had your job and I was I was all the extra money that I had I was spending it on alcohol on women like taking girls out like I was just I was living my life crazy in freaking while I remember once or not going to say a person's name I remember one summer me and this individual could kick it all the time we literally went up 7 days a week because my daughter and her and her mom and her family all went out on vacation so I took advantage of that I thought only uses time for me so let's go out so we literally hit every night club I was just confused I was lost I wanted attention to be honest and I was pleasing people I was always a huge in a bad way conversations to see how this is funny how life the universe and rebuild things is now being and I want to know how you shifted your mindset before you say anything like when you got introduced to Kevin David Wright Katie did he help to ship that when you kind of learn from him or did you learn as you went because growing a business and money and business is one thing and creating and crazy stuff but the mind says told the different like you increase affect the business would be a horrible person I want to see my headaches feel like spend all the money they sell the money and do things recklessly what made you switch what made you change what happened to your mind company was violated my probation cuz I was on informal probation and I ended up getting blocked up for 10 days and they call that a 10-day of where you violated your informal probation and that's pretty much he got in trouble with the law no matter how big or how small so if I even got like a traffic ticket I was in violation and if that officer is having a shity day he can technically got are on a roll you up and now you're going to spend 10 days in jail because now you're in violation of your probation because of my DUI what you do and in jail here in Sacramento at the downtown location but I was there for 10 days of real life like oh my God this close to right or just got done for massive f****** Samoan guy tattoos everywhere like this dude was huge and wonder how the cops got him in Yuba City small little town I don't know that he told you but I first walked in there in like 3 days. The guys that you look at them even if they're skinny with no muscle your life like that guy that came up and they're like the girl to take off your shirt affiliated would like the blues and reds or whatever and why are my eyes open up so that I'm potentially my teacher try to be cool enough crazy text messages one and I reflected on all of that and I said no. DMS is not their fault and he says I got that accountability and all that s*** works right but it's oppressive what's really internally going on on the inside of what is really going to change and what's going to change as you look at yourself in this accountability and you say to look being or look Rachel you're really f****** up stop f****** up you loser cuz this is a truly honest with myself and I got myself spiritually internally mentally thinking and all that game this is where you're at if you can I was getting fights when I was going going out in the hot head over right at the moment I started to drink 3 drink champagne or whatever 3 drinks is my limit yeah, that was my turn and if so I left there after the 10 days and I made the metal decision as you know what I'm going to change and I don't care what he wants us I don't care who's around. Business but I want to build a massive movement of different people coming from different parts of the world different background it was but coming again tell me something for themselves so that they can say what I said earlier is that they can go to people and say hey I built this for me and it's not so much that feeling that you get when you build something let me know what you think that away from me no one can take no matter how much they want no one can take that success organically an authentically say to yourself that look I did this because I and so that's exactly what it happened so I was getting people Amazon but now what I do is yes all I can give you Amazon all day long if you see anyone you know how to do it right now I want to really give you is your perspective on life because if the way you do money but that doesn't change things you're still going to be so let's just get it of how to get money so that you can stop freaking peeing so consumed on having your focus on money are you are you up if you weren't to make another dollar like past every month what you already made your mind with that yeah you're fine without us Leo what about the people that are do you think they're being selfish you think they're they're just want to see if money is not mean like X or used or even given right I got my number one love love language is getting s*** away why do all these giveaways I can give out courses and like my course completed you're free sometime you know based on whatever I'm trying to do before the individual that wants more and I don't necessarily see if it's greasy or you are selfish on their part I would just ask him some questions like why are you giving it away are you creating Legacy for your family down there is doing it just to do it like what's your mother read it and then it becomes why do you have it why do you want more of it but what you're lying because of your why it is not aligned up with those two three things and I don't think you should have it because then eventually you might fuss I want to know what is a person that just has build a community of people so that they focus not on money as hard as a do currently right now because they have it enso building and cultivating the culture of people that really are just focus on different things actually have an impact on Friends Community relationship really authentic I know that's a word that a lot of people just f****** throw out there but we don't I feel like I'm not a lot of people know the weight of that word of just simply being authentic so what I started to do that was really was able to relate to people outside and why I think i'll tell just showing them Amazon is why I think the key is that people like this is my life this is what happened in my past and Amazon happen and what's your story and be brave enough to be vulnerable so that you can really build something for you and a lot of students have really open up to me not just about basement but about it too and so I'm super grateful and I'm super thankful for that is that I'm just building a business but at the same time we can community of people that are changing really internally they're changing their perspective of how they escaped and how they see life and how they take in a potential struggle in a special before a lot of people that was trying to go in until I got into my actual god-given which was helping people giving back building a community to let people can really build something for themselves that's why lyrics to explode a lot but I've had people ask me like dinner at your one-hit-wonder the dean you and these are just like people that are never going to change my f****** hate later it's going to be huge and I'm just super just write from someone that was I would say a nobody I would say someone that was really living a life that was just this 10 now giving back in the way I get back with showing people practical with a step-by-step get there I'm in love with greatest woman wears I just cry because it's a beautiful thing we're doing that event November nights in Sacramento and what I have on a massive Community skill and showing people how to do and then we continue to build this massive tell these people where they can find you record everything like that's all you so where can I find you Dina salta salta is m a s a l t a m out that at my Facebook is also a d masalta into my Instagram is also Dimas office on very easy of time first and last name on all or any platform is just being myself that I'm doing that yes for marketing but also it's it's convenient for easy answer for you just based off a type of person that you are but I always like to ask people at the very end is there any type of opportunity which I'm sure if you guys have been listening is very clear but opportunity for people to work with you to learn from you to get mentorship from you to just ask you a question and hear more you can hear about them they can hear about you but more so just yeah I would say the easiest access is to hit me up either on my Instagram account or on the YouTube channel that I just that I just launched in the commentary regarding anything cuz I'm going to be very active on there a bro how you still doing in like what's your number but that's only 30 days or so perfect Instagram is the easiest way to figure
